	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm an artist in my spare time, alongside having an interest in computers and programs.<br>
			I first started coding websites in highschool as part of an intro to coding class, recently taking another class in college as part of an IT Certification program.<br>
			I intend to finish this program so that I am able to work in IT, although I am unable to provide a date for graduation at this time due to my schedule outside of classes and plans for the future.</p>
		
	<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>I have taken multiple classes on html & css as well as other coding languages.<br>
		As stated in the About Me section, I am completing an IT Certification with intentions to go into the field later.<br>
		Currently I am certified in HTML and CSS, with some knowledged in C#.<br>
		Alongside this, I intend to learn python in the future as well as a handful of other languages, although I tend to prefer hardware to software.</p>
